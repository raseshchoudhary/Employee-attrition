Are you an HR head or in that department and have often wondered what you can do to minimize the attrition in you company? This project will help you better understand the working enviorment in your company in a much better way. When it comes to employees they are very much like children which are needed to be taken care of and companies must understand the behaviouur of their employee as they will eventally work for the company and lead to better results and increased profits. With the being said, lets take a cursory look at the variables given in this dataset.

# About the dataset:

This dataset give entensive information about the employees in a company and their details such as their age, gender, education, department, distance from home etc. Apart from this certain KPI's are also mentioned such as the engagement ratio and performance score. 

The cherry on the cake is that it mentions almost all the employee welfare KPI's which may be causing them to leave the company such as work life balance, job satisfaction, relationship satisfaction etc. These are ofcourse some of many such variables given in the dataset. Lets now take a look at some valuable insights.

# Key Insights:

1.The females in the company have more experienced than males in general.Secondly they also thrash men in terms of performance rating.THEN "WHY WHY WHY" ARE THEY BEING PAID LESS THEN MEN !!!!!!!!.The HR should delve deeper into the issue as iron it ASAP.

2.Lottery for the managers:The job role for managers although miniscule, is available in all the departments.HR has the least number of job roles to offer.Job roles like Laboratory Technician,Research scientist and sales executive have abundant employees.

3.Area of focus:HR HR HR!! It seem as if company has foresaken this department what may lead to utter disaster. Least number of hirees from HR. And WAIT, WHY ARE THE MEN WORKING OVERTIME MORE THAN WOMEN.

4.The underlying message is:The company should plan to hire more females to boast a good gender diversity.The company doest not have any pre-requirement for matital status.

5.LOYAL EMPLOYEES!!!!There is a positive correlation b/w the two variables.Meaning that employees are becoming more experienced while they are a part of the company.

6.Most fo the employees travel rarely, meaning that they dont travel for business purposes. BUT WAIT a small fraction of them do travel frequently

7.Alert for the minors!!The company does not hire minors, all the employees are adults (Above 18 years are age).

8.Good news for the company! Most of the employees live near to the office so the tardy ones should be penalized.The company has the decent equilibrium between experienced and not so experienced employees.Remaining charts are quite self understood.

This dataset would be applicable to the HR of a company who want to appraise the employee performance and their overall well being. Suppose your boss asked you to find the cause of the high attrition in the company along with some visualizations, then you can have a look the visualizations and insights given in this project to draw a parallel and take suitable courses of action.

# Side note:

What ever visualization I made in this project have been made using a python library called matplotlib. No other library has been used apart from this one. Also I would urge the reader to visit the ipynb file to look the the visualizations to better understand the insights I have mentioned above.
